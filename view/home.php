<h1>Welcome to Pie.</h1>
<p>Congratulations on installing Pie, a PHP application development framework.</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<ul>
	<li>To edit this page, navigate to <code>/view/home.php</code> in your file browser.</li>
	<li>To create object classes, simply create appropriately-named tables in your database. They will auto-magically appear in Pie.</li>
	<li>Your site settings are stored in <code>/core/db.php</code>. This file is generated during the install; you may edit these at any time.</code></li>
</ul>

<h2>Philosophy</h2>

<p>Pie was conceived to fill an apparent void in PHP frameworks. At Pie, we believe that things should &ldquo;just work.&rdquo; When you sit down to code, your time from concept to implementation should be minimized as much as possible. Other frameworks require configuration and coding after installation. With Pie, <b>coding is optional.</b></p>

<p>On the other hand, Pie does not have much built in functionality beyond the basics. Our belief is that complicated frameworks actually make coding less flexible. By providing only a basic feature set, we allow you to write your own code with greater freedom as you see fit.</p>
